Get a better bessel function so that we can compute the exact golovin
solution for larger arguments.

Add implicit, adaptive timestepping for the condensation ODE solver.

Use HDF5 for a binary version of inout_*().

Implement a better poisson distribution generator. We should probably
generate a poisson sample per-bin, rather than doing a total sample
and then using a slow sampling to pick samples one-by-one.

convert all num_conc and similar to num_den or similar

add separate del_t for mosaic, coag, and cond. check on input that
t_output, etc are multiples of del_t so that the n_time header
information is actually correct.

aero_binned is really storing #/dln(m)/m^3 or something?

memory leaks: all types should have alloc_*() and free_*() functions
and should call them.

pass full particle data to the kernel_*() functions so that we can do
proper density-dependent brownian kernels. Requires a separate
max_kernel_*() function for each one.

update comments at top of files

what's happening with util_rand() and USE_F95_RAND? I think it can be
removed.

change units from (m^3) to [m^3]

update function names/arg orders in aero_state.f90

Use mpi_sizeof() to get the sizes for reals, logicals, etc. There are
also functions called MPI_Sizeof1DR8 for a 1D array of real*8,
etc. What about 2D arrays, is it correct to treat them as 1D as we do
at present with mpi_pack?

we call env_data_init_state() twice, once from partmc and once from run_mc

make mosaic compilation optional with a -DPMC_USE_MOSAIC

rename env to env_state

add halve() just like double() to downsample

add env%day_of_year (days since jan 1) and env%time_of_day (secs since
midnight) and shift info on start day, start time, etc to
env_data. Change mosaic_timestep() to just read time/day info out of
env directly. Update this info in env_data_update_state().

in aero_data and process_summary use AERO_NAME_LEN instead of
hard-coding 15, or at least assert that it is 15

rename constants_t contents to have more descriptive names (M_a ->
air_molec_weight, etc).

change gas conc from ppb to mole proportion

fix test/* for gnuplot, shifting "with lines" to end

allow times to be input as 1d, 34m, etc. No unit implies seconds.

number state files consectutively

change aero_particle_solute_density() etc to have aero_particle as the
first argument.

delete the unused bits of process_state() for the old histograms

test speed of code with test_sedi_exp() and many particles where we
explicitly recalc aero_binned for output, rather than keeping it
updated on the fly. If the penalty isn't too great, we should just
switch to computing it on output.

add H2O as a gas species and just track it as a regular gas, getting
rid of relative humidity in env. add a relative_humidity(env,
gas_data, gas_state) function.
