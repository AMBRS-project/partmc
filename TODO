Convert all num_conc and similar to num_den or similar

Update comments at top of files.

What's happening with util_rand() and USE_F95_RAND? I think it can be
removed.

Update function names/arg orders in aero_state.f90.

Fix the handling of comp_vol in aero_dist_sample() and
aero_state_sample().

Rename util_rand() to pmc_rand()?

We call env_data_init_state() twice, once from partmc and once from run_mc.

Check that everything works ok without MOSAIC compiled in.

Rename env to env_state.

In aero_data and process_summary use AERO_NAME_LEN instead of
hard-coding 15, or at least assert that it is 15.

Rename constants_t contents to have more descriptive names (M_a ->
air_molec_weight, etc).

Change gas conc from ppb to mole proportion.

Change aero_particle_solute_density() etc to have aero_particle as the
first argument.

Change the hardcoded list of mosaic aerosol species to not have _a on
them, so we can stop having _a in all the partmc data.

Remove sys.path.append(~/.python), use PYTHONPATH env variable instead
on OS X.

Kill aeroptical.dat output from MOSAIC.

Change Makefile to build partmc and process_state in the main
directory (not src).

Change process_state to be a mode of partmc with "run_type process" --
update README.

Need an averaging thing for the netcdf data files for multiple loops.

Change Makefile to not use FFLAGS as the thing to set, but rather use
DEF_FFLAGS or something, and include FFLAGS without settting it. Also
print out all settings before starting compilation.

Rename env.f90 to env_state.f90

Golovin testcase (and maybe others) need loops > 1.

Change assert() to print "ERROR (PartMC-########): message".

Change process_state to output netcdf?

Write netcdf_average helper.

Get a better bessel function so that we can compute the exact golovin
solution for larger arguments.

Add implicit, adaptive timestepping for the condensation ODE solver.

Implement a better poisson distribution generator. We should probably
generate a poisson sample per-bin, rather than doing a total sample
and then using a slow sampling to pick samples one-by-one.

Add separate del_t for mosaic, coag, and cond. Check on input that
t_output, etc are multiples of del_t so that the n_time header
information is actually correct.

aero_binned is really storing #/dln(m)/m^3 or something?

Pass full particle data to the kernel_*() functions so that we can do
proper density-dependent brownian kernels. Requires a separate
max_kernel_*() function for each one.

Use mpi_sizeof() to get the sizes for reals, logicals, etc. There are
also functions called MPI_Sizeof1DR8 for a 1D array of real*8,
etc. What about 2D arrays, is it correct to treat them as 1D as we do
at present with mpi_pack?

Change gas mixing to be by diffusion, rather than allreduce, also env.

Add env%day_of_year (days since jan 1) and env%time_of_day (secs since
midnight) and shift info on start day, start time, etc to
env_data. Change mosaic_timestep() to just read time/day info out of
env directly. Update this info in env_data_update_state().

Allow times to be input as 1d, 34m, etc. No unit implies seconds.

Add H2O as a gas species and just track it as a regular gas, getting
rid of relative humidity in env. add a relative_humidity(env,
gas_data, gas_state) function.

Memory allocation policy should be that all functions must be called
with an already allocated structure. That is, always call type_alloc()
before calling anything else. The functions will call type_free() if
they need to before writing new data, or will take care of
(de)allocation internally. Currently at least the spec_read functions
don't free before setting new values and should be fixed.

Fix local variable sections to always be all integers, then all reals,
etc, with only one "integer ::" and then & for the rest of the lines.

Change spec_read_aero_data to spec_read_aero_data_filename and pass in
the name, and similar spec_read_*.

Add allow_halve to control that separately.

Add parameter to composition processing for type: vol, mass or mole.

Use switch/case rather than elseif chains.

Fix calling convention for aerosol_optical from mosaic.f90. Do we do
it every timestep, or just when needed, or what? What about
coagulation? Does this come in the right order?

Change aero_dists to actually store the distribution parameters,
rather than generating the discretized version immediately. This will
allow us to sample log-normal and others exactly.

Maybe generate initial number of particles from a Poisson
distribution, rather than just using the mean as we do now?

Use doxygen to generate docs. Fortran supported as of version 1.5.4.

Fix MPI so it works again.
