Shift code into a separate (partbox?) repository for PNNL to access.

Add the rest of the kernels and init_dists to the various bits of partbox.f

Make process_state use allocatable arrays.

Make process_state not need to have everything set inside it.

Reformat argument description comments and remove double spaces

Make sure all functions have a description at the top of them

Remove dT/dt from env and pass mc_fix_hybrid a list of times and
temps, so that it can do linear interpolation to set the
temperature. Write a function in util.f to actually do the linear
interpolation.

rho_a should be shifted from constants to environ
check whether atm should also shift from constants to environ

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add implicit, adaptive timestepping for the condensation ODE solver.

The initialization routines in init_dist.f are assuming
logarithmically spaced bins, irrespective of what bin_r and bin_v
actually contain. dlnr is the width of a bin in the logarithmic scale,
and we just multiply this by the density to get the number per bin. We
should instead multiply the density by ln(bin_right_edge) -
ln(bin_left_edge) or similar. In general, we should stop passing dlnr
around, as it should be recalculable from bin_r for each bin.

use HDF or CDF or something to store state

get a better bessel function so that we can compute the exact golovin
solution for larger arguments.

Make a bin structure to store all the bin data. Add bin_edges so that
we have bin_centers and bin_edges. Use a 1D_search to locate particle
in bin. Compute the bin_centers and bin_edges using something like
logspace(1e-24,1e-4,160).

We keep track of M all the time (total number of particles). Should we
just recalc from sum(MH) when we need it? When do we even need it? For
progress display to test the need for double.
