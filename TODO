Add implicit, adaptive timestepping for the condensation ODE solver.

The initialization routines in init_dist.f are assuming
logarithmically spaced bins, irrespective of what bin_r and bin_v
actually contain. dlnr is the width of a bin in the logarithmic scale,
and we just multiply this by the density to get the number per bin. We
should instead multiply the density by ln(bin_right_edge) -
ln(bin_left_edge) or similar. In general, we should stop passing dlnr
around, as it should be recalculable from bin_r for each bin.

Use HDF or CDF or something to store state. (and output?)

Get a better bessel function so that we can compute the exact golovin
solution for larger arguments.

Add bin edges to bin_grid. Use a 1D_search to locate particle in
bin. Compute the bin_centers and bin_edges using something like
logspace(1e-24,1e-4,160), rather than always assuming logarithmically
spaced bins.

make_bin_grid should take r_min, r_max and n_bin

store densities directly in bin_dist so that it is independent of
comp_vol. Then we won't need output_summary_density() anymore.

remove bin_dist and use aero_dists instead. change aero_dist to
directly store density per species, rather than vol_frac. change
aero_mode_t to just be a 2D array per bin/species.

rename environ to env_t

treat bin_dist just as a summary thing. have something in
output_summary that computes the summary data and outputs it.

write proper serialization code for all objects. change
read/write_state() to use it.

use size(array,dim) rather than shape()

add inout_read_named_real_array() and similar to do what
read_real_array() does in read_spec.f90 now, then separate out the
spec_*() functions for compound datatypes into the respective files

convert all num_conc and similar to num_den or similar

stop passing bin_grid and aero_data around just to get n_bin and
n_spec. Instead derive on the spot from array sizes.

split singlestep_mosaic() to an _init() and the real _step() thing.

add separate del_t for mosaic, coag, and cond.

change run_sect and run_exact to generate aero_dists

fix up output_summary to use aero_state, etc, and also inout_file_t
