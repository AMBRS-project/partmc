Get a better bessel function so that we can compute the exact golovin
solution for larger arguments.

Add implicit, adaptive timestepping for the condensation ODE solver.

Use HDF5 for a binary version of inout_*().

Implement a better poisson distribution generator. We should probably
generate a poisson sample per-bin, rather than doing a total sample
and then using a slow sampling to pick samples one-by-one.

convert all num_conc and similar to num_den or similar

add separate del_t for mosaic, coag, and cond. check on input that
t_output, etc are multiples of del_t so that the n_time header
information is actually correct.

aero_binned is really storing #/dln(m)/m^3 or something?

memory leaks: all types should have alloc_*() and free_*() functions
and should call them.

pass full particle data to the kernel_*() functions so that we can do
proper density-dependent brownian kernels. Requires a separate
max_kernel_*() function for each one.

Fix process_state.

update comments at top of files

what's happening with util_rand() and USE_F95_RAND?

change units from (m^3) to [m^3]

update function names/arg orders in aero_state.f90

Use mpi_sizeof() to get the sizes for reals, logicals, etc. There are
also functions called MPI_Sizeof1DR8 for a 1D array of real*8, etc.

we call env_data_init_state() twice, once from partmc and once from run_mc

make mosaic compilation optional with a -DPMC_USE_MOSAIC

rename env to env_state
