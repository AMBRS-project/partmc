Rename bin_r, bin_v, bin_g, bin_n to make it clear that bin_r/bin_v
are the independent variables, while bin_g/bin_n are the dependent
variables.

Remove bin_r, replacing bin_r(i) with vol2rad(bin_v(i))

We are actually storing volumes in bin_g - update comments to reflect this.

Write vol2rad() and rad2vol() in util.f

Change init_exp() to return a floating-point concentration curve
rather than actual number. Let compute_volumes handle the conversion
to integer.

Add adaptive timestepping for the condensation ODE solver.

The initialization routines in init_dist.f are assuming
logarithmically spaced bins, irrespective of what bin_r and bin_v
actually contain. dlnr is the width of a bin in the logarithmic scale,
and we just multiply this by the density to get the number per bin. We
should instead multiply the density by ln(bin_right_edge) -
ln(bin_left_edge) or similar. In general, we should stop passing dlnr
around, as it should be recalculable from bin_r for each bin.

remove particle_vol_hybrid(), particle_vol(), particle_vol_base(),
particle_volume() and replace with sum().

also output bin_v in state

use HDF or CDF or something to store state
