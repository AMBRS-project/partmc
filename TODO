Rename bin_r, bin_v, bin_g, bin_n to make it clear that bin_r/bin_v
are the independent variables, while bin_g/bin_n are the dependent
variables.

Remove bin_r, replacing bin_r(i) with vol2rad(bin_v(i))

We are actually storing volumes in bin_g - update comments to reflect this.

Write vol2rad() and rad2vol() in util.f

Change init_exp() to return a floating-point concentration curve
rather than actual number. Let compute_volumes handle the conversion
to integer.
