make deps isn't happening automatically

Fix mc_exact to also use the t_print = 0d0 convention to not print.

Stop using magic file number 30 for the output file.

Add a "make test" to run everything and compare the output files of
various things.

Rename t_print to t_output and t_progress to t_print

Change endif/enddo to end if/end do

Change copyrights to include 2007

Make sure all functions have a description at the top of them

Reformat parameter description comments and remove double spaces

Add restart arguments to mc_fix_hybrid to get it to restart

Add do_coagulation and do_condensation parameters to mc_fix_hybrid to
tell it whether to do each process.

Remove dT/dt from env and pass mc_fix_hybrid a list of times and
temps, so that it can do linear interpolation to set the
temperature. Write a function in util.f to actually do the linear
interpolation.

Rename bin_r, bin_v, bin_g, bin_n to make it clear that bin_r/bin_v
are the independent variables, while bin_g/bin_n are the dependent
variables.

Remove bin_r, replacing bin_r(i) with vol2rad(bin_v(i))

We are actually storing volumes in bin_g - update comments to reflect this.

Write vol2rad() and rad2vol() in util.f

Change init_exp() to return a floating-point concentration curve
rather than actual number. Let compute_volumes handle the conversion
to integer.

deps: should be changed to Makefile.deps: in Makefile

Add adaptive timestepping for the condensation ODE solver.

The initialization routines in init_dist.f are assuming
logarithmically spaced bins, irrespective of what bin_r and bin_v
actually contain. dlnr is the width of a bin in the logarithmic scale,
and we just multiply this by the density to get the number per bin. We
should instead multiply the density by ln(bin_right_edge) -
ln(bin_left_edge) or similar. In general, we should stop passing dlnr
around, as it should be recalculable from bin_r for each bin.

remove particle_vol_hybrid(), particle_vol(), particle_vol_base(),
particle_volume() and replace with sum().

also output bin_v in state

use HDF or CDF or something to store state
