Brownian Lognormal Test-case
===================================

The initial condition is a single species of particle with two overlapping 
lognormal distributions and the simulation using the brownian
kernel. No analytical solution is known for this case, so a sectional
code is used as verification. By default this testcase uses 10^5
particles, performing 1 Monte Carlo simulation

This test-case demonstrates the use of the sectional model and
comparison of sectional runs with Monte Carlo runs.
