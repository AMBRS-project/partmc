\section{Averaging}

Here everything is written as if we are averaging all particles. In
reality, we first organize the particles into size bins and then only
average within each bin.

\begin{align*}

\section{Weighted Averaging (Volume/mass-preserving Version)}

We follow the last section, but assume that we have a weighting
function $W(v)$.

\begin{align*}
  \intertext{Given:}
  v_i^a &= \text{volume of species $a = 1,\ldots,A$ in particle $i = 1,\ldots,N$} \\
  W(v) &= \text{weighting function at volume $v$} \\
  \intertext{Define:}

  v_W^a &= \sum_{i=1}^N W(v_i) v_i^a = \text{weighted total volume of species $a$ in all particles} \\
  v_W &= \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{a=1}^A W(v_i) v_i^a = \sum_{i=1}^N W(v_i) v_i = \sum_{a=1}^A v_W^a = \text{weighted total volume of all particles} \\
  N_W &= \sum_{i=1}^N W(v_i) = \text{weighted total number} \\

  \intertext{properties of weighted composition averaging:}

  \intertext{weighted size averaging defined by:}
  \check{v}_i^a &= \frac{v_i^a}{v_i} v^* \\

  \intertext{If $W$ is continuous then at least one $v^*$ exists in $\left[\min_{i=1}^N(v_i), \max_{i=1}^N(v_i)\right]$. If $v W(v)$ is also strictly monotonic (as is the case for us) then $v^*$ is unique.}
  \intertext{properties of size averaging:}

  \check{v}_W &= \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{a=1}^A W(\check{v}_i) \check{v}_i^a = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{a=1}^A W(v^*) \frac{v_i^a}{v_i} v^* = \sum_{i=1}^N W(v^*) v^* = v_W \text{ (weighted total volume is preserved)} \\

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \intertext{if weighted size averaging is done after weighted composition averaging then:}
  \check{\tilde{v}}^a_i &= \frac{\tilde{v}_i^a}{\tilde{v}_i} \tilde{v}^* = \frac{v_W^a v_i}{v_W} \frac{1}{v_i} \tilde{v}^* = \frac{v_W^a}{v_W} v^* \\
  \intertext{where we use the fact that $\tilde{v}^* = v^*$ arising from the requirement:}
  \sum_{i=1}^N W(\tilde{v}^*) \tilde{v}^* &= \sum_{i=1}^N W(\tilde{v}_i) \tilde{v}_i = \tilde{v}_W = v_W = \sum_{i=1}^N W(v_i) v_i = \sum_{i=1}^N W(v^*) v^* \\
  \intertext{properties of weighted size averaging after weighted composition averaging:}

  \check{\tilde{v}}_W^a &= \sum_{i=1}^N W(\check{\tilde{v}}_i) \check{\tilde{v}}_i^a = \sum_{i=1}^N W(v^*) \frac{v_W^a}{v_W} v^* = v_W^a \text{ (weighted total species volumes are preserved)} \\
  \check{\tilde{v}}_W &= \sum_{a=1}^A \check{\tilde{v}}_W^a = \sum_{a=1}^A v_W^a = v_W \text{ (weighted total volume is preserved)} \\

  \frac{\check{\tilde{v}}_i}{\check{\tilde{v}}_W} &= \frac{v^*}{v_W} \text{ (particle volume ratios of weighted total volume are all equal)}
\end{align*}

Note that we could preserve both volume/mass concentrations and number
concentrations exactly by also adjusting $V$ to $\check{V}$ so that
\begin{align*}
  \frac{1}{\check{V}} \sum_{i=1}^N W(v^*) &= \frac{1}{V} \sum_{i=1}^N W(v_i) \\
  \frac{1}{\check{V}} \sum_{i=1}^N W(v^*) v^* &= \frac{1}{V} \sum_{i=1}^N W(v_i) v_i
\end{align*}
This requires:
\begin{align*}
  v^* &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N W(v_i) v_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N W(v_i)} \\
  \check{V} &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N W(v^*)}{\sum_{i=1}^N W(v_i)} V
\end{align*}
As we are doing this per-bin, however, we would end up with different
$\check{V}$ for each bin, which is not helpful.

happens if $V$ is adjusted to preserve both volume/mass and number.
