Here comes the introduction. This text cites \citet{Murphy2006}.

  \caption{\label{fig:2d_scrit_nc_61} Two-dimensional projections of
    the 20-dimensional number distribution after 24~hours of
    simulation (at 06:00~LST). The left panel shows the
    two-dimensional projection as a function of dry diameter and the
    dry mass fraction of black carbon, while the right panel shows the
    two-dimensional projection with respect to dry diameter and
    critical supersaturation. The plotted number concentrations have
    been capped to better show the features in the data. Note the
    structures in this high-dimensional data that are lost in current
    aerosol models, resulting in errors in predicted quantities as
    shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ssa_ccn}.}

This is how we refer to Figure \ref{fig:2d_scrit_nc_61}.
