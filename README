INSTALLATION
------------

The Makefile is currently written to use gfortran (tested on Linux
with gcc 4.1.1 and OS X with gcc 4.2.0), but it should compile ok with
any Fortran 90/95 compiler.

The Makefile is generated by the makemake.py Python script, which
parses the source code to determine the module dependencies. Running
"./makemake.py > Makefile" or "make make" will regenerate the
Makefile. Edit makemake.py rather than Makefile.


USAGE
-----




CODING CONVENTIONS
------------------

The auto-generation of module dependencies relies on a particular
naming convention. The module names must be the same as the name of
the containing file, but prefixed with "mod_". Thus the module
mod_condensation is contained in the file condensation.f.

Some of the source code is in free-format, and some in
fixed-format. Because gfortran requires a commandline switch to
compile the different forms, there is a list of files in makemake.py
that are in free-form.
