INSTALLATION
------------

By default the Makefile will use gfortran (tested on Linux with gcc
4.1.1 and OS X with gcc 4.2.0).

To use Portland Group compliers run with "make FC=pgf95" (tested with
pgf95 6.0-8 on x86-64 Linux).

The Makefile requires GNU make (tested with versions 3.79.1 and 3.80).


USAGE
-----

The run_* files are example simulations. The output files state_XXXX.d
are processed with process_state, while the out_*.d files are
processed with process_out.


CODING CONVENTIONS
------------------

The auto-generation of module dependencies relies on a particular
naming convention. The module names must be the same as the name of
the containing file, but prefixed with "mod_". Thus the module
mod_condensation is contained in the file condensation.f.

If the "use" statements in a program change then the dependencies need
to be regenerated with "make deps".
